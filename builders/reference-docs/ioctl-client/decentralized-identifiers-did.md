The DID contract on **IoTeX testnet** is:

The DID contract on **IoTeX mainnet** is

`TBD`

### Generate a DID Doc Template <a href="#generate-a-did-doc-template" id="generate-a-did-doc-template"></a>

Generate DID document template using an account from ioctl. The produced template can be modified as needed with its hash to be recalculated.

```
ioctl did generate [-s SIGNER] [flags]

```

Example:

```javascript
ioctl did generate -s test1
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:io:0x476c81C27036D05cB5ebfe30ae58C23351a61C4A",
  "authentication": [
    {
      "id": "did:io:0x476c81C27036D05cB5ebfe30ae58C23351a61C4A#owner",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:io:0x476c81C27036D05cB5ebfe30ae58C23351a61C4A",
      "publicKeyHex": "0355237d4af6afc7f139e396329d56a4d1235c94abde9a25782241774c06cccfb6"
    }
  ]
}

The hex encoded SHA256 hash of the DID doc is:21e575fd6fd75591465481404986fac73de766446c793ff67adfa171d51adf85
```

### Upload a DID Doc

DID Doc can be uploaded to any publicly accessible content storage like S3 or IPFS or other cloud storage, as long as you end up with a URI which can retrieve you DID Doc.

If you plan to use IPFS, you can either set up your own IPFS node or use service like https://pinata.cloud/ or upload via https://globalupload.io/.

Exmaple:

```
https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNNhWHyi5tRH78QqcTYHwfyNc3bbuLZTTvmk3UhWdAWjG
```

### Hash a DID Doc

DID register asked for a 32 bytes hash of the DID doc as an input. You could use any hashing algorithm to fit your need. Once you got your DID Doc hash, encode it to a hex string, to pass into `ioctl`. **For simplicity, you can directly use the hex-encoded SHA256 hash string provided by `ioctl did generate`**. But if you do need to generate a hash programmatically, here is a Go example to hash a DID doc using SHA512-256 and output a hex string:

```javascript
package main

import (
	"crypto/sha512"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
)

var doc = `{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "id": "did:io:0x476c81C27036D05cB5ebfe30ae58C23351a61C4A",
  "authentication": [
    {
      "id": "did:io:0x476c81C27036D05cB5ebfe30ae58C23351a61C4A#owner",
      "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1VerificationKey2019",
      "controller": "did:io:0x476c81C27036D05cB5ebfe30ae58C23351a61C4A",
      "publicKeyHex": "0355237d4af6afc7f139e396329d56a4d1235c94abde9a25782241774c06cccfb6"
    }
  ]
}`

func main() {
	sum := sha512.Sum512_256([]byte(doc))

	fmt.Println(hex.EncodeToString(sum[:]))
}
```

### Register a DID <a href="#register-did" id="register-did"></a>

Register a new DID with the corresponding doc to IoTeX.

```
ioctl did register (CONTRACT_ADDRESS|ALIAS) hash uri [flags]

```

Example:

```
ioctl did register io1m3wjevwhz2s58sasq0wj4luxrnqt047s687zw8 21e575fd6fd75591465481404986fac73de766446c793ff67adfa171d51adf85 https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNNhWHyi5tRH78QqcTYHwfyNc3bbuLZTTvmk3UhWdAWjG -s test1

```

### Resovle DID <a href="#resovle-did" id="resovle-did"></a>

Resovle an IoTeX DID with our web resovler.

```
http://did.testnet.iotex.one/1.0/identifiers/<DID>

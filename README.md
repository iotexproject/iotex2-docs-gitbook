[IoTeX 2.0 Whitepaper release](welcome-to-iotex-2.0/whitepaper.md)
{% endhint %}

Since its inception, IoTeX has been a pioneer in the blockchain industry, focusing on creating secure and scalable infrastructures that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Initially established as a Layer 1 blockchain, IoTeX has expanded its vision by spearheading the development of **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePINs).**

## What is IoTeX 2.0?

IoTeX 2.0 unveils its brand new vision, upgrading its L1 blockchain into an open **Modular Infrastructure for all DePINs**.&#x20;

The new [whitepaper](welcome-to-iotex-2.0/whitepaper.md) provides a comprehensive tech stack including composable modules and a unified **trust layer** to accelerate DePIN adoption. All underpinned by our **new tokenomics** design that links together the interconnected set of DePIN Dapps, L2 chains, modules, and devices.&#x20;

IoTeX 2.0 is embarking on a new roadmap to onboard 100 million devices and unlock trillions of dollars in real-world value on chain within the next 3-5 years. Realizing IoTeX’s mission of “DePIN for Everyone”.

> "_At IoTeX, we firmly believe small teams with big hearts should have full support to build impactful DePINs. Because together, we can make more. That is the foundation of IoTeX's 2.0 mission to democratize DePIN for everyone._" - Raullen Chai, CEO & Cofounder of IoTeX\

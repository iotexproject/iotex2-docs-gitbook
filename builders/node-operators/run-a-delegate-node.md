## Configure a Delegate

When setting up a full node as a Delegate in the IoTeX network, it's recommended to mitigate external attack risks by not configuring the same node as a gateway. For comprehensive guidelines on establishing a Delegate, please refer to the specific documentation provided for this purpose. This ensures that your setup adheres to best practices for security and functionality within the IoTeX ecosystem.

Check the dedicated delegate documentation:

### Delegate Endorsement

**Delegate Endorsement** is a feature that allows aspiring Delegates to participate in IoTeX governance and consensus without meeting the 1.2M IOTX self-stake requirement. By receiving endorsements from stakeholders who stake on their behalf, Delegates can actively contribute to the network, while Endorsers earn rewards and influence governance without managing a node.

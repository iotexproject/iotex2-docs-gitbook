# ERC20 and NFT Tokens

## **What Are ERC20 Tokens and NFTs?**

ERC20 tokens provide a standardized approach for creating fungible tokens on EVM blockchains, facilitating everything from decentralized finance to governance mechanisms. NFTs, on the other hand, certify the uniqueness and ownership of digital assets, opening up possibilities for art, collectibles, and beyond.&#x20;

IoTeX supports ERC20 tokens and NFTs through its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. This allows developers to deploy Ethereum-based smart contracts directly on IoTeX, taking advantage of faster transaction times, reduced costs, and enhanced scalability.

### **ERC20 Tokens**

ERC20 is a protocol standard that defines rules for issuing fungible tokens on Ethereum. Key functions include:

* `totalSupply()`: Displays the total token supply.
* `balanceOf(address)`: Provides the token balance of a specific account.
* `transfer(address, amount)`: Enables token transfers between accounts.
* `approve(address, amount)` and `allowance(owner, spender)`: Manage spending permissions.

### **NFTs**

Unlike ERC20 tokens, NFTs are unique digital tokens that represent ownership and authenticity of a specific item or asset, managed on the blockchain. Each NFT has distinct information or attributes that make it irreplaceable, making them ideal for applications in digital art, real estate, and more.

### **Advantages on IoTeX**

Using ERC20 tokens and NFTs on IoTeX offers several benefits:

**Faster Transactions:** IoTeX’s blockchain architecture offers quicker transaction confirmations with instant finality compared to other EVM blockchains.

**Lower Fees:** Transaction costs on IoTeX are significantly lower, enhancing the economic viability for microtransactions, large-volume operations, and contract executions.

**DePIN Applications:** IoTeX’s focus on Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) integrates ERC20 and NFTs with real-world data and utility, enabling use cases like the incentivization of community-owned infrastructure and data marketplaces.

# Example Use Cases

At its core, **ioID** provides a decentralized identity framework for machines, smart agents, and physical AI, including:

* Verifiable, portable identity using W3C-compliant DIDs
* On-chain representation through Device NFTs and Machine-Bound Accounts (MBAs)
* Ownership binding to human wallets
* Trusted data exchange via decentralized credentials and proofs

This trusted infrastructure allows devices to securely participate in decentralized applications, verify their status, and act autonomously on behalf of their owners.

Using ioID as a foundation, DePIN projects and developers can build a wide range of services—many of which are already in development or being explored:

### **🔍 Device Discovery on depinscan.io**&#x20;

_**Live Soon**_

An on-chain explorer that indexes and displays registered machines, their identity metadata, and activity. This improves transparency and helps stakeholders discover and validate devices across the network.

### **💰 Incentive Distribution**&#x20;

_**In Development**_

Automated token rewards can be routed directly to a device’s MBA based on activity, data contribution, or uptime—removing the need for manual payout processes.

### **🔐 Proof-of-Liveness**&#x20;

**In Development**

Enables devices to cryptographically prove their active status and secure environment (via TEE/ZKP), allowing use in trusted data pipelines and reward validation.

### **📊 Token Staking**&#x20;

**Planned**

Devices can autonomously stake tokens using their MBA, participate in governance, or access services that require bonded collateral.

### **🤝 Device Financing & Lending**&#x20;

**Planned**

Verified machines with a strong reputation or predictable income could become eligible for credit, leasing programs, or other DeFi-powered financing mechanisms.

## Future Possibilities

As ioID matures, it opens the door to innovative use cases like:

* Reputation systems for machines
* Machine-to-machine microtransactions
* IoT-based insurance with verifiable claims
* Autonomous agent marketplaces

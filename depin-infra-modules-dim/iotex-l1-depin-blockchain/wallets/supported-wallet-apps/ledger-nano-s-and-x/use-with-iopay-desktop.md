# Use Ledger with IoTeX Hub Portal

Please note that the recommended way to use a Ledger Hardware Wallet with IoTeX is by using the Ethereum Ledger App and pairing it with a Web3 wallet such as [Metamask](use-with-metamask.md) or [Rabby](use-with-rabbit-walet.md).

{% hint style="success" %}
The option below, is intended specifically for existing users who previously created an IoTeX wallet using the older IoTeX Ledger integration.&#x20;

# IoTeX Developer Portal

{% hint style="success" %}


We are excited to announce the upcoming launch of our new Developer Portal, designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools and resources for DePIN builders. Here's a quick overview of what you can expect:

## Upcoming Developer Portal Features

1. **Manage Developer Accounts**: Easily create and manage your developer account, keeping track of your projects and activities in one place.
2. **Claim Test Tokens**: Access test tokens to experiment with and test your DePIN projects in a sandbox environment.
3. **Token Deployment Tools**: Deploy your tokens with our user-friendly tool, based on the popular [Openzeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) code, making it simple to create and deploy your tokens.
4. **DePIN Contract Deployment**: Seamlessly deploy DePIN contracts that integrate with [W3bstream](../depin-infra-modules-dim/w3bstream-depin-verification/overview-of-w3bstream.md), enabling you to build decentralized infrastructure with ease.
5. **Off-Chain DePIN Verification Logic**: Implement and manage off-chain verification logic for [W3bstream](../depin-infra-modules-dim/w3bstream-depin-verification/overview-of-w3bstream.md), to ensure the integrity and security of your DePIN applications.
6. **ioID sandbox**: Experiment with DePIN identities with [ioID, our DePIN Infra Module](../depin-infra-modules-dim/ioid-depin-identities/) (DIM) for decentralized identity management.

# Integration Tier

The Integration Tier of the IoTeX Project Grants is designed specifically for projects and teams aiming to integrate their existing dApps or tools with the IoTeX ecosystem. Whether you're porting an application from another blockchain or developing a new tool such as a wallet, DeFi platform, or blockchain indexing solution, this tier is tailored to support seamless integration and collaboration. With the Integration Tier, we offer not only funding based on the project's scope, popularity, and potential impact on the IoTeX ecosystem, but also the invaluable technical support of our product and infrastructure teams. Join us in expanding the IoTeX ecosystem and making your mark on the future of decentralized technology.

<summary>Milestone Guidelines</summary>

For each milestone, payouts will be issued on a monthly basis for 1 year, meaning that each milestone amount will be divided by 12 (months) and paid monthly if the relevant metric has been met for that month. Since the success of a milestone is assessed by the team monthly, it's important to keep the metrics consistent over time.

* **Number of Milestones:** \
  We encourage projects to stick to 3 milestones, unless strictly necessary.
* **Completion Time:** \
  Completing a submission should not take much more than 3 months (if you're applying for a larger project, think about splitting it into multiple submissions)
*   **Metrics:**

    Remember that these metrics are assessed monthly, and should be consistent over time. While these are the **ONLY** metrics we accept, it is up to you to attach an amount to them that is proportional to the funding you're requesting.

    \- **TVL** (Total Value Locked)

    \- **Transaction Volume**

    \- **Community Engagement**\


    Some **example metrics** might look like this:&#x20;

    * _**1M USD of TVL** (Total Transaction Locked) on IoTeX per month_
    * _More than **20,000 daily blockchain transactions** consistently over 1 month_
    * _Twitter marketing mentioning IoTeX, e.g. minimum **1 Tweet/day over one month**, with a minimum number of "**n**" impressions overall_\



* **Funds distribution across milestones:**\
  15% - 25% - 60%

# Set up your Environment

## Overview

Setting up your development environment for IoTeX involves choosing the right Web3 tools and frameworks to streamline your workflow.&#x20;

Popular options include [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Foundry (Forge)](https://getfoundry.sh/), and  [ApeFramework](https://www.apeworx.io/framework/). These frameworks offer robust Dapp testing, deployment, and debugging capabilities. Once you are ready to deploy your smart contracts to the testnet or mainnet, you simply need to change the RPC endpoint in your tools configuration.&#x20;

## Development Frameworks

1. [**Hardhat**](https://hardhat.org/): A flexible and extensible framework that helps developers compile, deploy, test, and debug their Ethereum software.
2. [**ApeFramework**](https://www.apeworx.io/framework/): Ape Framework is an easy-to-use Web3 development tool. Users can compile, test, and interact with smart contracts all in one command line session. Ape supports multiple contract languages and chains.
3. [**Foundry (Forge)**](https://getfoundry.sh/): A fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development. Forge is the command-line tool for Foundry, providing robust smart contract development and testing capabilities.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

6. [**IoTeX Dev Portal**](https://developers.iotex.io)**:** the one-stop-shop for any IoTeX Developer. Claim test tokens, deploy tokens and explore the DePIN sandbox from a simple web interface.
7. [**Remix**](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en\&optimize=false\&runs=200\&evmVersion=null\&version=soljson-v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a.js): A web-based IDE for writing, compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

## Libraries and SDKs

6. [**Web3.js**](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.0/): A JavaScript library that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket.
7. [**Ethers.js**](https://docs.ethers.org/): A complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem.
8. [**MetaMask SDK**](https://metamask.io/sdk/): Provides tools and APIs for building DApps with MetaMask, enabling seamless integration and enhanced functionalities.

## Testing Tools

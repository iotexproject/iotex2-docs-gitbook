# On-chain integration

To utilize the proofs generated by W3bstream in your Dapp contract, it's essential to verify the receipt on-chain. In this section of the documentation, we will explore how smart contracts of DePIN projects can receive a W3bstream proof, verify it, and utilize the computation results to trigger token economies. For example, this might involve awarding crypto assets to device owners upon proving that certain "work" has been performed in the physical world by the DePIN device.

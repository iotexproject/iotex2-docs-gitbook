# End-to-End DeWi Demo

This guide will walk you through creating a complete **Decentralized WiFi Infrastructure (DeWi)** project using IoTeX's modules and tools, and demonstrate how to utilize IoTeX's infrastructure in a real-world DePIN project.

We have created a GitHub repository for this project, which you can find at:

{% embed url="https://github.com/machinefi/iotex-dewi-demo" %}

We will keep this guide and the repository up to date with the latest modules and tools from IoTeX.

We encourage you to contribute to the project by submitting pull requests or opening issues on the GitHub repository and help us improve and expand this resource for the entire DePIN community.

Let's start this journey and explore the full potential of IoTeX's DePIN ecosystem and bring your innovative ideas to life!

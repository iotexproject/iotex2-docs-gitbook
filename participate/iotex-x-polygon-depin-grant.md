# IoTeX x Polygon DePIN Grant

Following the announcement of the IoTeX and Polygon's AggLayer integration, our teams have joined forces again for another super exciting venture. This time, IoTeX is joining the **Polygon Grant Allocator program** and will deploy **1M $POL** to accelerate the next wave of **high-potential DePIN projects**, helping them reach mainstream adoption.

### Grant Overview

As part of this program, IoTeX will select a handful of **highly promising DePIN projects** to join our ecosystem and leverage our **cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure.** This initiative is designed to fast-track these projects toward their **Token Generation Events (TGEs)** and **mass adoption,** while driving traffic to the Polygon AggLayer once the integration is complete.

### What We’re Looking For

We are seeking **DePIN projects** that demonstrate:

* **Proven expertise and innovation** in their respective fields.
* A **committed and capable team** that can execute on ambitious goals.
* Early growth-stage progress, specifically in the **seed or Series A stages.**
* Plans to **launch their TGE** on IoTeX within **Q1–Q2 of this year.**

This grant program is **by invitation only,** but we encourage exceptional teams to submit their project details using the form at the bottom of this page. We’ll review submissions and reach out if we see potential for collaboration.

### Why IoTeX?

IoTeX is the **first and only cohesive blockchain-based infrastructure** purpose-built for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks). As the most mature DePIN Layer 1, IoTeX provides a **comprehensive tech stack** designed to power the next generation of real-world applications. Grant recipients will gain access to:

* **IoTeX Layer 1 Blockchain**: A scalable, efficient, and secure foundation for decentralized innovation.
* **ioID**: Our unified identity management solution, enabling seamless cross-chain operability.
* **W3bstream**: A pioneering off-chain computing framework that connects real-world devices and data to Web3 applications.

With these tools, projects can build, scale, and innovate while staying ahead in the rapidly growing DePIN landscape.

### Program Goals

Our mission is to enable DePIN projects to achieve:

* **Accelerated growth and adoption** through access to **Polygon's 1M $POL allocation** and IoTeX’s robust infrastructure.
* **Mainstream readiness** by integrating IoTeX’s technology stack and leveraging the Polygon AggLayer for cross-chain capabilities.
* Substantial contributions to **IoTeX’s ecosystem** and increased activity on the AggLayer.

### How to Apply

We are looking forward to learning about exceptional DePIN projects. If you believe your project is a fit for this program, please get in touch by **using the form below** to:

* Introduce your team and project.
* Share resources such as pitch decks, product demos, and other relevant materials.
* Explain why your project aligns with our goals and mission.

**Note**: We will only contact projects if we decide to move forward with an invitation or would like to learn more. If you don't hear back from us, don't get discouraged, we're only looking at a limited number of projects, and there are always many factors involved in these decisions. We want to thank you in advance for your time and effort!&#x20;

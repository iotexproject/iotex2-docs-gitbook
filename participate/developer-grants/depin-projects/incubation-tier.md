<summary>Milestone Guidelines</summary>

For each milestone, payouts will be issued on a monthly basis for 1 year, meaning that each milestone amount will be divided by 12 (months) and paid monthly if the relevant metric has been met for that month. Since the success of a milestone is assessed by the team monthly, it's important to keep the metrics consistent over time.&#x20;

* **Number of Milestones:** \
  We encourage projects to stick to 3 or 4 milestones, unless strictly necessary.
* **Completion Time:** \
  Completing a submission should not take much more than 6 months (if you're applying for a larger project, think about splitting it into multiple submissions)
*   **Metrics:**\
    Remember that these metrics are assessed monthly, and should be consistent over time. While these are the **ONLY** metrics we accept, it is up to you to attach an amount to them that is proportional to the funding you're requesting.

    \- **TVL** (Total Value Locked)

    \- **Transaction Volume**

    \- **Community Engagement**\


    Some **example metrics** might look like this:&#x20;

    * _**1M USD of TVL** (Total Transaction Locked) on IoTeX per month_
    * _More than **20,000 daily blockchain transactions** consistently over 1 month_
    * _Twitter marketing mentioning IoTeX, e.g. minimum **1 Tweet/day over one month**, with a minimum number of "**n**" impressions overall_\

* **Funds distribution across milestones:**\
  5% - 15% - 30% - 50%\

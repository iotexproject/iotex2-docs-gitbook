# \[ioConnect] Hardware SDK

The IoTeX's **ioConnect SDK** is a software development toolkit for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It aims to facilitate the rapid and convenient transformation of traditional Web2-based IoT projects into Web3 ones by providing a suite of developer-friendly components such as the Arm certified PSA crypto APIs, decentralized identifiers (DIDs), verifiable credentials (VCs), and DIDComm messaging.&#x20;

The ioConnect SDK is compatible with a wide range of embedded systems (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Nordic, STM32, etc.) and developers can easily integrate the SDK into their existing or ongoing traditional IoT projects within minimal code changes.]

# ESP32 Boards

Please refer to the [→ README](https://github.com/machinefi/ioConnect/blob/main/doc/How\_to\_Create\_a\_Project\_on\_the\_ESP32\_Platform.md) file on  GitHub for a tutorial on how to use ioConnect into an IDF project.

## Example

The ioConnect repository includes several examples of using ioConnect on different boards. The examples range from generating DIDs, registering device ioIDs, and establish a secure communication with a server using the DIDcomm, a DID-based secure protocol.

# Set up your Environment

## Overview

Setting up your development environment for IoTeX involves choosing the right Web3 tools and frameworks to streamline your workflow.&#x20;

Popular options include [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), and [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). These frameworks offer robust Dapp testing, deployment, and debugging capabilities. Once you are ready to deploy your smart contracts to the testnet or mainnet, you simply need to change the RPC endpoint in your tools configuration.&#x20;

# 1.0 Device Registration

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** This document applies to Pebble Trackers that run a software version `v1.0.x` and have not been registered on  [machinefi.com](https://machinefi.com). If your Pebble Tracker is already registered please proceed with the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")
{% endhint %}

## Turn on your Pebble Tracker

Wait for the Pebble Tracker to establish a cellular connection and begin communicating with the network. You will then be prompted to initiate the registration process, which will link the device to your IoTeX wallet as its owner.

## Creating a MachineFi Account

To register a Pebble Tracker on the IoTeX MachineFi portal, you first need to create a blockchain account. This account will serve as the **owner account** for all associated devices. Follow the steps below to get started:

{% hint style="success" %}
**Prerequisites**:

* You have [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download/) installed in your browser or [ioPay mobile](https://iopay.me) on your smartphone.
* If using Metamask, ensure you [added the IoTeX Network](https://developers.iotex.io)&#x20;
* You own some [native IOTX](https://docs.iotex.io/depin-infra-modules-dim/iotex-l1-depin-blockchain/wallets/buy-iotx-tokens) in your wallet account&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please make sure your wallet is connected to the IoTeX blockchain and you have a few **IOTX native** tokens in your wallet. You can get IOTX native tokens on the IoTeX network from [most exchanges worldwide](https://docs.iotex.io/depin-infra-modules-dim/iotex-l1-depin-blockchain/wallets/buy-iotx-tokens).&#x20;

**Also, please notice that Coinbase only supports IOTX on the Ethereum blockchain (ERC20) which would not work.**
{% endhint %}

Open the MachineFi device portal at [portal.machinefi.com](https://portal.machinefi.com), and **connect** a blockchain wallet account that you want to use as your _Devices_ _Owner Account,_ the portal will automatically start the account registration process:

## Depositing Credit

Once a MachineFi account is created, you should **deposit some IOTX credit**. This step is not strictly required at this moment: if you want, you can skip it and go ahead with registering your Pebble. You can deposit credit at any moment.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
While you do not need any credit to monitor your Pebble data history on the MachineFi portal, please keep in mind that you need to deposit IOTX into your MachineFi account to allow your device to send data to IoTeX Dapps.
{% endhint %}

To deposit some credit:

1. Switch to the [**Account**](https://portal.machinefi.com/account) page&#x20;
2. Click the **Deposit Credit** button&#x20;
3. Input the amount of IOTX you want to deposit
4. Confirm the deposit dialog
5. Finally, confirm the transaction in the wallet&#x20;

On the same **Account** page, you can also withdraw your MachineFi credit at any time, as well as check the list of all your account transactions.

## Registering your Pebble

You can now switch to the [**Devices**](https://portal.machinefi.com/device) tab of the portal, which lists all the devices you associated with your MachineFi account. For a newly created account, with no devices added yet, the page will look like the one below, just click the **Add Device** button:

<figure><img src="https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-docs-gitbook/raw/master/.gitbook/assets/add-device.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

select "**Pebble**" to register and add a new Pebble Tracker to your MachineFi account:

{% hint style="success" %}
Make sure your Pebble is powered on and [prompting for device registration](1.0-device-registration.md#power-on).
{% endhint %}

Go ahead and press the **Next** button, confirm the transaction in your wallet, and wait for your blockchain address to be displayed on the Pebble tracker screen:

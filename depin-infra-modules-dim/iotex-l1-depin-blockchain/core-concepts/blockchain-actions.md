# Blockchain Actions

Like other blockchains, IoTeX was bootstrapped from an initial ("genesis") state, which is then altered over time through transactions, or "Actions" as they are called in IoTeX.&#x20;

An action is fundamentally a packet of data, signed by a blockchain account, that instructs the blockchain to make a specific change to the distributed ledger. The action can be sent to any blockchain node acting as a gateway, which in turn broadcasts it to the entire network of nodes for verification. Once verified, it gets applied and stored permanently in the ledger.

In IoTeX, there are different types of Actions depending on the type of operation required:

<details>

<summary>Transfer Action</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Execution Action</summary>



</details>

<details>

<summary>Governance Actions</summary>



</details>

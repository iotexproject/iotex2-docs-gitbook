# Ledger Nano S & X

[Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) and [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) are hardware wallets, which are considered very secure for the storage of **private keys** in the blockchain world. When using a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano, your digital assets are safe even when operating on a compromised (or untrusted) PC.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Ethereum App for Ledger** (_Preferred)_

This option uses the Ethereum Ledger App, which can be paired with popular Etehreum-compatible desktop applications like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Rabby Wallet](https://therabbit.io/).&#x20;

**IoTeX App for Ledger**

This involves using the IoTeX Ledger App in conjunction with the [IoTeX Hub Portal](https://hub.iotex.io/assets) to manage your assets, and on other Dapps websites that support direct browser connection with the IoTeX Ledger App..&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Depending on the combination of the app on your Ledger key, and the wallet software you're utilizing, here are your available options:

1. **Ethereum App on Ledger + Metamask** \
   This is the preferred setup and enables you to transfer both native IOTX and any ERC20 tokens on the IoTeX network. Additionally, it supports managing staking actions on [stake.iotex.io](https://stake.iotex.io/my-votes#myVote).&#x20;
2. **IoTeX App on Ledger + IoTeX Hub Portal**\
   This option is available for existing users that created an account in the IoTeX Ledger App in the past. As the option above, it enables you to transfer both native IOTX and any ERC20 tokens on the IoTeX network, and supports managing staking activities on [stake.iotex.io](https://stake.iotex.io/my-votes#myVote).

3. **Ethereum App on Ledger + Ledger Live Software**: \
   Allows only for the transfer of IOTX in the form of ERC20 tokens (e.g. on the Ethereum or Polygon blockchains).

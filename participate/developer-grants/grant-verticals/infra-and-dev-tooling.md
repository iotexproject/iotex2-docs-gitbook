# Infra & Dev Tooling

The growth and success of a blockchain ecosystem greatly depend on the quality and accessibility of its infrastructure and development tools. The IoTeX Halo Grants Program encourages developers to build innovative and user-friendly infrastructures and dev tooling that make it easier for other developers to create, test, and deploy their projects on the IoTeX platform. By leveraging IoTeXâ€™s advanced technology and W3bstream infrastructure, our grant recipients can create powerful solutions that help streamline and enhance the development process for the entire IoTeX ecosystem.

### IoTeX Improvement Proposals <a href="#what-are-iotex-improvement-proposals" id="what-are-iotex-improvement-proposals"></a>

An _IoTeX Improvement Proposal_ (or "_IIP"_) is a design document providing information to the IoTeX community, or describing a new feature for [**IoTeX**](https://iotex.io/), its processes, or its environment.

IIPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and documenting the design decisions that have been implemented in the IoTeX ecosystem.

### Submitting an IIP <a href="#submitting-an-iip" id="submitting-an-iip"></a>

Anyone is welcome to submit an IoTeX Improvement Proposal (IIP).&#x20;

To begin, the proposal should be posted on the [IoTeX Governance Forum](https://community.iotex.io/c/governance-proposals/78), including a clear technical description and a rationale for the proposed change. The author is responsible for engaging the community, building consensus, and recording any opposing viewpoints.

The [IoTeX Governance Tool](https://hub.iotex.io/governance)â€”accessible via the [IoTeX Hub portal](https://hub.iotex.io/)â€”is a free platform that allows IoTeX stakers to participate in governance by voting on proposals. IIPs that gain sufficient community interest will appear on the tool for voting.

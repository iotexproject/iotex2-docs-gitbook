# Registering Identities

This section is dedicated to the process of registering identities within the IoTeX ecosystem, particularly for DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) projects and devices.

**Register a DePIN Project**

To initiate a DePIN project and register device identities, you must first register your project with the IoTeX network. This process involves:

* Providing a project name.
* Referencing your "Device NFT" contract.
* Receiving a "Project ID" in the form of an NFT.

**Register Devices**

For devices to interact with the IoTeX blockchain, they must be assigned to a DePIN project, registered, and verified. This ensures that all devices and their data are verifiable across all layers of the DePIN architecture. The process involves:

* Requesting a number of ioIDs for a DePIN project.
* Activating these ioIDs through a device registration and owner binding process.

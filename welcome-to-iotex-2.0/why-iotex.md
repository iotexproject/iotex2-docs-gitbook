# ðŸ’¡ Why IoTeX

Discover why IoTeX is the ideal platform for building and deploying your Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) projects. Explore the key features and advantages that make IoTeX stand out.

## **1. Modular DePIN Infrastructure**

IoTeX offers a modular approach allowing DePIN projects to construct a tech stack tailored to their needs. This includes **critical products** **built in-house** by IoTeX and **integrations with partner products** from top projects. This modularity enables DePIN builders to focus on what they do best (their infrastructure) while utilizing cutting-edge Web3 technologies such as Decentralized Identities, off-chain scaling, zero-knowledge proofs, and artificial intelligenceâ€‹â€‹.

## **2. MSP: A Unified Security Layer for DePINs**

The IoTeX Modular Security Pool (MSP) provides a unified trusted layer, offering security and trust to DePIN Infrastructure Modules (DIMs) and DePIN applications. This system leverages existing security from established L1 blockchains like IoTeX, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, and utilizes **restaking** to ensure a robust and secure foundation for new projectsâ€‹â€‹.

## **3.** End-to-End Support for DePIN Lifecycle

IoTeX 2.0 offers full support for DePIN projects throughout their lifecycle. From initial stages focused on **tech stack** development to later stages requiring **scalability** **and decentralization**, IoTeX provides the necessary infrastructure and public resources to capture attention, liquidity, and usersâ€‹â€‹.

## **4. Public Goods and Resources: tools for DePIN growth**

IoTeX provides a suite of public goods designed to support DePIN builders. These include user-facing tools (e.g., [explorers](https://depinscan.io), [wallets](https://wallet.iotex.io), [bridges](https://iotube.org)), developer-focused tools (e.g., IDEs, SDKs), and network-wide resources (e.g., [governance](https://gov.iotex.io), [accelerator](https://iotex.io/blog/depin-accelerator/), [liquidity](https://iotex.io/depin-liquidity)). This ecosystem of tools and resources helps builders launch their projects more easily and provides the foundation for growthâ€‹â€‹.

## **5.** Meritocratic Tokenomics: Incentivizing Value

IoTeX employs a meritocratic tokenomics system designed to reward significant contributions. The IOTX token is more than just an L1 protocol token, it is used to incentivize various DePIN stakeholders, ensuring that rewards are distributed based on the value provided to the network. This system drives new utility to the IOTX token, making it a **foundational currency for the DePIN sector**â€‹â€‹.

## **6.** Leading the Innovation with **Cutting-edge Technologies**

IoTeX integrates advanced technologies such as **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)**, **trusted execution environments (TEE)**, and **self-sovereign identity (SSI)** for devices. These technologies enhance security, scalability, and trust within DePIN projects, enabling innovative and secure applicationsâ€‹â€‹.

## **7. Decentralized Governance**

In addition to the existing [decentralized process](https://gov.iotex.io/) for managing Improvement Proposals for the blockchain, IoTeX 2.0 introduces one more important pillar for decentralized governance: [The Marshall DAO (IIP-23)](https://community.iotex.io/t/iip-23-the-marshall-dao/11172). Marshall DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that will enable IoTeX stakeholders to make proposals regarding how to allocate IOTX incentives to grow the IoTeX ecosystem, including onboarding reputable DePIN projects and funding network-wide initiatives. This creates a transparent and meritocratic system where the best projects are funded using IOTX. allowing stakeholders to contribute to the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem.

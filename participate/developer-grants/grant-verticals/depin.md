# DePIN

[**Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)**](https://iotex.io/blog/what-are-decentralized-physical-infrastructure-networks-depin/) are transforming the way we interact with and manage physical systems by securely connecting IoT devices and infrastructure with blockchain technology. At IoTeX, we understand the tremendous potential of DePIN projects and encourage developers of all skill levels to join our grant program to create groundbreaking DePIN applications. We’re excited to support your journey in harnessing [**IoTeX**](https://iotex.io/) and our layer-2 infrastructure, [**W3bstream**](https://w3bstream.com/), to shape the future of decentralized physical infrastructure. W3bstream plays a critical role in DePIN projects, providing the foundation for secure and efficient communication between smart devices and smart contracts.

### Decentralized Solar Energy Marketplace

**Project Name**: SolarDex

**Description**: SolarDex aims to create a decentralized marketplace for peer-to-peer solar energy trading, allowing individuals with solar panels to sell their excess energy to others within the community. The project will leverage IoTeX and W3bstream to securely process IoT data from smart meters and integrate it with smart contracts to enable transparent and efficient energy trading.

**Milestones:**

1. Deploy a working version of the SolarDex project on IoTeX Testnet, showcasing the core features of the decentralized solar energy marketplace.
2. Deploy the SolarDex project on IoTeX Mainnet, enabling users to trade solar energy securely and efficiently within the community.
3. Increase user base by 20% within three months of Mainnet deployment, demonstrating the project’s scalability and impact.

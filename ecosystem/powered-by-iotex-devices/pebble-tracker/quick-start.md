## Finding a SIM Card

Pebble Tracker connectivity supports both [LTE-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-M) and [Narrowband-IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrowband_IoT) cellular technologies, which provide radio bands that are optimised for IoT applications like smart metering, industrial controls, residential security, etc.

**Note:** The SIM card is not included with Pebble Tracker

IoTeX has partnered with [1NCE](https://1nce.com/), an IoT SIM cards provider that covers over 100 countries and regions globally, providing a convenient data plan: if your country is covered, you can buy a Pebble-ready SIM card on the dedicated IoTeX "**Autobahn.earth**" portal:

If your country is not currently covered by the 1NCE network, below are some useful information for you to find a working SIM card for your Pebble Tracker:

{% hint style="info" %}
**Is your country covered by the Narrowband-IoT network?**

Please check if either NB-IoT or LTE-M is available in your Country [on the gsma website](https://www.gsma.com/iot/deployment-map/).  Once you know which technology is supported, please find a local or international provider where you can buy a SIM card that supports the correct technology for your country.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Make sure the IoT SIM card you buy supports either NB-IoT or LTE-M**

Please notice that Pebble tracker does not support GSM, 3G, or 4G bands:\
make sure your SIM card provider supports either **NB-IoT** or **LTE-M** or both in your country.
{% endhint %}

If you have issues finding a working SIM card, please join this forum discussion where other community members share their experiences with different SIM card providers in their country:

## Installing the SIM card

Once you have a SIM card, use a paperclip or the provided SIM card tool to open the SIM slot and push the card inside:

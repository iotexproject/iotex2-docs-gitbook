# DeFi

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial landscape by enabling open, transparent, and accessible financial services built on blockchain technology. At IoTeX, we recognize the immense potential of DeFi applications and invite developers of all skill levels to participate in our grant program to develop innovative DeFi projects. Whether you’re creating an original DeFi application or porting an existing one from a different ecosystem, we’re eager to support your journey in leveraging IoTeX and our layer-2 infrastructure, W3bstream, to build the future of decentralized finance.

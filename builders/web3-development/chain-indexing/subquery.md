# SubQuery

SubQuery is an open and flexible data indexing framework for web3.&#x20;

SubQuery allows every team to process and query their data. The project is inspired by the growth of data protocols serving the application layer and its aim is to help projects build better dApps by allowing anyone to reliably find and consume data faster.&#x20;

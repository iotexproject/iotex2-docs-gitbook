# ioID v2 Overview

## What is ioID?

ioID is an advanced identity system dedicatedly built for enabling trust in machine economy, smart agents and physical AI, which consists of an on-chain and off-chain component, respectively.

* **On-Chain Identity**: ioID relies on an _NFT-bound smart contract wallet_ to represent identity of a machine on the blockchain, which enables the machine to manage token rewards and participate in various DeFi applications. &#x20;
* **Off-Chain Identity**: ioID leverages _self-sovereign identity_ (i.e., decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials) to enable secure machine-to-people (M2P) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.

## Design Goals

ioID is introduced to achieve the following three primary design goals:

* **Global Machine Identity Registry**: ioID aims to create a unified on-chain machine identity registry that allows anyone to search, visualize and verify machine identity. Such an on-chain identity registry establishes the trust foundation for machines interacting with various services and applications.&#x20;
* **Machine Economy Enabler**: ioID aims to unlock the potential of machine economy by equipping each machine with a programmable, NFT-bound smart contract wallet, which provides unlimited opportunities for machines engaging with on-chain financial applications.
* **Verifiable Data Facilitator**: ioID aims to serve as the facilitator for data intensive applications such as smart agents, physical AI, etc. to collect trustworthy and verifiable data.&#x20;

## System Architecture

A high-level system architecture of ioID is illustrated in the figure below.

ioID consists of the following core components:

* **Decentralized Identifier**: A [decentralized identifie](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/)r as specified by W3C is used as the unique and portable identifier for a machine.&#x20;
* **Device NFT**: A device NFT as specified by [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) is used to tokenize a machine on-chain and usually issued by a DePIN project.
* **Machine-Bound Account (MBA)**: A machine-bound account is a smart contract wallet inspired by [ERC-6551](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551), which is bound to a device NFT and is able to directly interact with various decentralized applications (dApps). &#x20;

## Integration Benefits

A DePIN project that integrates ioID is able to achieve the following great benefits:

* Join the DePIN and AI communities to build the first-ever global machine identity registry and visualize the rich person-machine relationship
* Gain trust and confidence with respect to the project growth &#x20;
* Get early access to a suite of machine-driven DeFi applications (staking, lending, renting, etc.) &#x20;
* Shape the future of smart agents and physical AI players with DePIN data

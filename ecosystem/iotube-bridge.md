# iotube Bridge

iotube is a decentralized bridge facilitating the bi-directional transfer of tokens among the IoTeX network, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Solana. **iotube** stands as a cornerstone for dApp developers on the IoTeX blockchain, offering a streamlined tool for their tokens to gain multi-chain functionality. By integrating with iotube, a token deployed on the IoTeX blockchain can be automatically spread across the most prominent blockchains, simplifying the creation of multi-chain dApps.

## **Key Features**

* **Open for All dApps:** Any dApp deployed on the IoTeX blockchain is eligible to submit their token for iotube support, paving the way for a more interconnected and accessible blockchain ecosystem.
* **Ease of Use:** With just a single deployment, your token is automatically made available across leading blockchains, eliminating the complexity typically associated with achieving multi-chain presence.
* **Expand Your Reach:** Tokens originally deployed on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or Solana can seamlessly integrate into the IoTeX ecosystem. This expansion not only broadens the token's accessibility but also takes advantage of IoTeX's high-speed transactions and low fees.

By bridging the gap between IoTeX and other major blockchains, iotube empowers dApps and token holders with flexibility, reach, and efficiency.&#x20;

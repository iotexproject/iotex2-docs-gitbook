# Integrate ioID in your cloud

In scenarios where a DePIN project is unable to verify a device’s authenticity on-chain, this approach enables off-chain device authentication. The project can act as a “trusted entity” within an “ioID proxy” contract, authorizing on-chain registration and binding on behalf of the actual device owner.

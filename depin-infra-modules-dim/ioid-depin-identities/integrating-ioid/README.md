# Integrating ioID

Integrating ioID is just a 3-step process for any project:

1. Create a project account on depinscan.io and get your **API key**.
2. Register any of your newly activated device on-chain.
3. Send device data like health and location to depinscan.

The diagram below outlines the key stages for integrating ioID into a DePIN project—starting from one-time project registration, through device identity provisioning, to real-time data and DeFi interaction.

## Why integrate ioID?

A DePIN project integrating ioID unlocks powerful capabilities and ecosystem advantages:

**Join a unified identity ecosystem**

Collaborate with the DePIN and AI communities to build the first global machine identity registry, enabling rich and verifiable person–machine relationships.

**Build trust and transparency**

Strengthen project credibility by providing verifiable, on-chain identities for physical and virtual agents.

**Access machine-native DeFi**

Enable devices to autonomously participate in a suite of decentralized staking, lending, renting, and other DeFi applications via on-chain identity and wallets.

**Shape the future of AI and Physical Infrastructure**

Drive adoption and innovation at the intersection of smart agents, physical AI, and DePIN by providing trusted data and identities.

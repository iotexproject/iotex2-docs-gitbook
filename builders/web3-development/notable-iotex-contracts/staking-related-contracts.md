# Staking-Related Contracts

##

In addition to standard EVM transactions for native token transfers and contract executions, IoTeX introduces specialized transactions dedicated to the native staking functionality that is integral to the IoTeX consensus mechanism.

## System Staking Contract

To simplify the integration of staking features into decentralized applications (DApps) built on IoTeX, **system staking contract** is provided on the IoTeX blockchain. These contracts are essential for developers who wish to build liquid staking solutions or other tools that need to interact with the staking system directly from a smart contract.

### Use Cases

* **Liquid Staking**: Create solutions where users can stake their tokens while receiving a representative token that can be used in DeFi applications.
* **Staking Analytics and Reporting**: Access staking data to create dashboards that track delegate performance, voter engagement, and overall network health.
* **Governance and Voting**: Build tools that interact with staking-based governance systems to facilitate decision-making or voting mechanisms for IoTeX stakeholders.

## Staking NFT contract

One of the unique features of IoTeXâ€™s staking system is the ability to represent staking deposits as **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**. This innovative approach allows users to tokenize their stakes, enabling them to transfer, trade, or even fractionalize their staked tokens in a more flexible and creative manner. With staking as NFTs, IoTeX combines the benefits of staking with the versatility of NFTs, giving users new ways to interact with and manage their staking deposits.

### Use Cases

* **Staking Portability**: Users can transfer their stake between wallets or even trade them on NFT marketplaces without the need to unstake.
* **Enhanced DeFi Integrations**: Developers can create financial products that utilize staked assets as collateral, backed by the underlying staking NFTs.

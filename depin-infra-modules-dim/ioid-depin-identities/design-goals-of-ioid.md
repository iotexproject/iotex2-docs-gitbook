# Design Goals of ioID

ioID is designed to fulfill three primary goals that enable a secure and scalable identity layer for the machine economy:

**Global Machine Identity Registry**\
ioID provides a unified, on-chain registry for machine identities. This allows anyone to search, verify, and interact with registered machines, establishing a trust foundation for seamless integration with services, users, and decentralized applications.

**Machine Economy Enabler**\
ioID unlocks the potential of the machine economy by equipping each machine with a programmable, NFT-bound smart wallet. These Machine-Bound Accounts (MBAs) enable machines to earn, spend, and participate in DeFi and other on-chain activities autonomously.

**Verifiable Data Facilitator**: \
ioID supports data-rich applications—such as smart agents, physical AI, and autonomous systems—by enabling them to collect, prove, and share verifiable data using decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and cryptographic proofs.

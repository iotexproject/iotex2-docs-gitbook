# Node Operators

This section of the documentation outlines the various options for running and managing a node on the IoTeX, whether your goal is to serve as an RPC endpoint or participate as a delegate in the consensus process.

Node operators have the option to configure two types of IoTeX nodes: **Full Nodes** and **Archive Nodes**.

* **Full Nodes**: These nodes can be set up to provide an RPC endpoint for interacting with the blockchain, making them ideal for tasks such as configuring wallets and other clients. Additionally, Full Nodes can be configured as **IoTeX** **delegates**, allowing them to participate in the consensus process and contribute to block production.
* **Archive Nodes**: Archive Nodes go a step further by retaining the entire history of the IoTeX blockchain. This makes them great for quickly querying historical data without the state regeneration, and this is ideal for developers who create analytical tools, DApps, and other services that need quick history access.

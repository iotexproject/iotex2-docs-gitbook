# Smart Contracts

### Smart Contracts

Thanks to the native integration of the EVM, smart contracts on IoTeX function similarly to Ethereum. Developers upload reusable code pieces to the EVM's state, known as "smart contracts." These contracts, once invoked by sending a transaction to their address with specific parameters, execute the contract specific code performing some computations given certain conditions are met.&#x20;

For instance, transferring IOTX to a designated contract address might result in the assignment of a certain digital asset to the sender. Smart contracts allow Web3 developers to create trusted applications on the IoTeX network, ranging from games to financial tools to decentralized infrastructures and data marketplaces.&#x20;

# Deploy to W3bstream

To deploy your prover logic to the W3bstream network, you need to create a W3bstream **project file**. This file includes the binary code of the ZK Prover and the destination contract of the DePIN project that will receive the computation results and proof on the blockchain.

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that your ZK Prover circuit [is built and locate the binary file](../build-the-prover-code/).
{% endhint %}

# Rabby Wallet

Rabby Wallet offers a seamless and straightforward UI to engage with your assets, thanks to its native integration of the IoTeX Blockchain. This means that users do not need to undergo any additional configuration steps to manage their IOTX tokens, track their staked IOTX balance, participate in staking, or interact with IoTeX's decentralized applications (DApps).&#x20;

Its intuitive design and native integration with IoTeX make Rabby Wallet an excellent alternative to more generalist wallets like Metamask.

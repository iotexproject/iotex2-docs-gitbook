# Ledger Nano S & X

[Ledger Nano S](https://www.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s) and [Ledger Nano X](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x) are hardware wallets, which are considered very secure for the storage of **private keys** in the blockchain world. When using a hardware wallet like Ledger Nano, your digital assets are safe even when operating on a compromised (or untrusted) PC.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two distinct Ledger Hardware Wallet applications available for managing wallets on the IoTeX Blockchain:

1. **Ethereum Firmware for Ledger**: This option involves using the official Ethereum Ledger App, which can be paired with desktop applications like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Rabbit Wallet](https://therabbit.io/). _This is the preferred option_.
2. **IoTeX Firmware for Ledger + ioPay Desktop**: This involves using the official IoTeX Ledger App in conjunction with the [IoTeX Desktop Wallet.](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-desktop-wallet/releases) _However, it's important to note that IoTeX Desktop Wallet development has discontinued._
{% endhint %}

Depending on the combination of the app on your Ledger key, and the wallet software you're utilizing, here are your available options:

1. **Ethereum App on Ledger Hardware + Ledger Live Software**: \
   Allows only for the transfer of IOTX in the form of ERC20 tokens (e.g. on the Ethereum or Polygon blockchains).
2. **Ethereum App on Ledger Hardware + Metamask or Rabbit Software**: \
   This setup enables you to transfer both native IOTX and any ERC20 tokens on the IoTeX network. Additionally, it supports managing staking activities on [stake.iotex.io](https://stake.iotex.io/my-votes#myVote)
3. **IoTeX App on Ledger Hardware + ioPay Desktop Wallet**: same as the above, enables you to transfer both native IOTX and any ERC20 tokens on the IoTeX network, and supports managing staking activities on [stake.iotex.io](https://stake.iotex.io/my-votes#myVote). _However, it's important to note that IoTeX Desktop Wallet development has discontinued._

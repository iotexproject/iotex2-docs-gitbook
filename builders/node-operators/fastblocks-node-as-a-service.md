# Fastblocks (Node as a Service)

[_Fastblocks_](https://www.fastblocks.io/) is a PaaS (_Platform as a Service_) product, that aims to lower the threshold of accessing IoTeX data and solve the problems that arise when building nodes by yourself such as environmental consistency, security, network speed and storage space. The _Fastblocks_ platform is based on an advanced, dynamically scalable, and microservice-driven architecture, providing a service of resilient and dedicated nodes customized for IoTeX.

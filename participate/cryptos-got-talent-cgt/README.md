**Crypto’s Got Talent (CGT)** is the first-ever live talent show dedicated to discovering and supporting the most promising builders in the **Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN)** space. Powered by IoTeX in collaboration with Polygon and ElizaOS, CGT flips the traditional grant model on its head by running the entire selection process **live and in public**—giving projects unparalleled exposure from day one.

### 🎯 Our Mission

Our goal is simple: **find the best DePIN projects in the world** and help them succeed using IoTeX’s full-stack infrastructure. Whether you're building devices, networks, or tooling, CGT is your launchpad to real adoption.

### 🛠️ How It Works

CGT is structured like a reality show, in **three phases:**

#### Phase 1: Live Pitches

Projects apply and pitch live on X Spaces in front of high-profile guest judges, KOLs, and the community. The best pitches move to the next round.

**Phase 2: Demos & Deep Dives**\
\
Selected projects return to present product demos or pitch decks in video livestream format, showcasing real-world use cases and infrastructure alignment.

#### Phase 3: Finale & Funding

The finalists are selected in a live finale episode, where funding is awarded and support from IoTeX kicks into high gear to help them go to market.

### 📊 Season 1 Highlights (So Far)

* **190,800+ Impressions**
* **40,000+ Views Per Episode**
* **2,823 Votes** from the community
* **11 High-Potential Projects** advancing to the next phase
* Guest judges from top protocols, ecosystems, and DePIN leaders

### 🚀 Why It Matters

CGT is not just a grant program—it's a **movement**. We’re here to:

* Accelerate real-world DePIN adoption
* Support teams with infrastructure, funding, and exposure
* Grow the IoTeX ecosystem with builders who are solving real problems

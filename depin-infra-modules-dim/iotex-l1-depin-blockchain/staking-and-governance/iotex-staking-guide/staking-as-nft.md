# Staking as NFT

Staking as NFT introduces Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent your staking deposits. In this mechanism, when you stake your tokens, you receive an NFT that signifies ownership and details of the staked amount and lock options.

## Why Choose Staking as NFT?

Staking as NFT offers several benefits over native staking:

1. It enables participation in **Liquid Staking** or other **DeFi applications** and unlocks the potential to earn **additional passive income**.&#x20;
2. With your staking ownership being managed as an NFT token you have the option to liquidate your stake in an [NFT marketplace](https://nft.mimo.exchange/) for instance if  you initially set a lock period but you need your deposit back ahead of it to conclude.

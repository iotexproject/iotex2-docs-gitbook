# \[IoTeX L1] DePIN Blockchain

The Blockchain Layer acts as the trust anchor of a DePIN application, managing participant identities, transactions, device data, and status, among other functions. It also handles crucial tasks such as verification of off-chain computations, orchestration of machine networks, distribution of token rewards to DePIN miners, and on-chain governance.

## Introducing the IoTeX L1 Blockchain

Inspired by Ethereum, the IoTeX blockchain pioneers innovative solutions to address challenges related to blockchain scalability, which is paramount in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks. IoTeX makes it easy for Web3 developers to create trustworthy and decentralized applications that benefit from instant transactions with 1-block finality and a transaction fee of under $0.001.&#x20;

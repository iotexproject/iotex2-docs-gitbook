The DeWi (Decentralized WiFi Access Network) demo showcases the implementation of a DePIN project to create a community-owned decentralized WiFi network using the IoTeX blockchain.&#x20;

We will guide you through the entire process, from registering your DePIN project and devices on the IoTeX chain, to managing device registration and ownership on the firmware side. The demo includes developing a firmware for ESP32 boards, the DePIN verification logic using ZK, and creating a DApp that distributes incentives to the owners of the WiFi routers.&#x20;

# 👩‍💻 Integration Guide

This document will guide you through the prerequisites and setup required to start using ioID on the IoTeX testnet. By following these steps, you'll be able to configure your development environment and begin interacting with the ioID Module infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

{% hint style="info" %}
1. **ioctl CLI**

Ensure that you have [installed the IoTeX ioctl client](../../../builders/reference-docs/ioctl-client/) before proceeding.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/master/install-cli.sh | sh
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
2. **Testnet endpoint**

ioID is currently on testnet. Ensure you have configured ioctl with the IoTeX testnet endpoint:

`ioctl config set endpoint api.testnet.iotex.one:443`

[→ See more IoTeX RPC Endpoints](../../../builders/web3-development/rpc-endpoints.md)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
3. **Test Tokens**

Ensure you have some IOTX test tokens in your wallet balance

[→ Claim your test tokens on the Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io)

# \[W3bstream] DePIN Verification

## **The DePIN Verification Problem**

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) face unique challenges in verifying and processing physical device data while ensuring trust. On-device verification methods, such as using trusted execution environments in conjunction with blockchain-based identity management, can help solve data provenance verification. However, trusted processing of data is often overlooked by DePIN builders due to the lack of dedicated off-chain verifiable compute protocols suitable for DePINs.&#x20;

> _As a result, the core logic of DePIN projects, specifically the logic that triggers on-chain token economies, is not verifiable by anyone and thus not trusted._

## **W3bstream: Off-Chain Verification for DePIN**

W3bstream is an off-chain verifiable compute protocol designed by IoTeX to address the verification challenges in DePIN. Based on multi-prover technology, W3bstream ensures flexible and scalable verification of off-chain computations, mitigating risks like self-dealing, lazy providers, and malicious responses.

Combined with [ioID, IoTeX's unique identity system for DePINs](../ioid-depin-identities-v1/), W3bstream forms a robust infrastructure that ensures trust and integrity within DePIN ecosystems, enabling trusted and secure management of decentralized physical infrastructures.

# The Marshall DAO

In addition to the existing [decentralized process](https://gov.iotex.io/) for managing Improvement Proposals for the blockchain, IoTeX 2.0 introduces one more important pillar for decentralized governance: [The Marshall DAO (IIP-23)](https://community.iotex.io/t/iip-23-the-marshall-dao/11172). Marshall DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization that will enable IoTeX stakeholders to make proposals regarding how to allocate IOTX incentives to grow the IoTeX ecosystem, including onboarding reputable DePIN projects and funding network-wide initiatives. This creates a transparent and meritocratic system where the best projects are funded using IOTX. allowing stakeholders to contribute to the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem.

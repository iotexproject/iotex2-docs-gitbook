# Third-Party DIMs

Along with the core modules developed internally by the IoTeX developers, numerous modules will be sourced from leading projects in the blockchain space with specialized capabilities. For instance, the Data Availability layer is the main focus of projects like Celestia and NEAR, whereas the Long-term Storage layer is the central focus of projects like Filecoin and Arweave.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
As IoTeX 2.0 stresses modularity and composability, we invite all projects to integrate into the DIM layer, thus enabling DePIN projects to design a tech stack of their preference.

# Current Development Status

The ioConnect SDK currently supports a number of embedded communities as shown below. In particular, the PSACrypto library (i.e., the southern part of the ioConnect SDK) has been submitted to the [Arduino](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/psa-crypto) and [ESPRESSIF](https://components.espressif.com/components?q=iotex) communities and passed their component approval processes.

## Industry Certification and Recognition

The IoTeX's PSACrypto is a cryptographic library (the southen part of SDK) that supports a wide range of embedded devices with flash memory from as low as 20KB to several hundred MB. It is fully compliant with the Arm PSA Certified Crypto API 1.1 standard. With its unique frontend and backend design, it allows users to choose a backend cryptographic library that best suits their needs, thereby achieving a good balance between the performance and memory footprint. Moreover, an optimized visual configuration tool provides great flexibility for developers to customize a cryptographic library based on the available hardware resources and specific project requirements and facilitates developers to integrate the PSACrypto library into their projects seamlessly. The PSACrypto library has received the [PSA Certified Crypto API label](https://www.psacertified.org/products/iotex-psa-crypto/) from Arm.

### About the new v2.0 software version

The new Pebble Tracker software `v2.0` introduces support for **ioID**, IoTeX’s innovative decentralized identity framework designed specifically for DePINs.&#x20;

This upgrade transitions each Pebble device identity, already registered on the IoTeX blockchain, into the new ioID system, offering greater composability and standardization. These enhancements enable seamless integration with DeFi and DePIN dApps on the IoTeX L1, unlocking broader possibilities for Pebble Tracker users.

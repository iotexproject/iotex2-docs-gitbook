## Send transactions <a href="#export-the-hd-wallet" id="export-the-hd-wallet"></a>

Once you imported a seed phrase or created a brand new HD wallet, you can refer the private key of one of it's derived addresses with `hdw::a/b/c.`

For example, if you want to make an IOTX transfer from the first HD Wallet derived address, here is how you'd do it:

```
ioctl action transfer io1m22v9cnnjcktas584wcl96vl5z5e700l7fdvhk 10 -s hdw::1/1/1
```

or, an ioUSDT ERC20 transfer from the first derived address, would look like this:

```bash
ioctl xrc20 transfer io1m22v9cnnjcktas584wcl96vl5z5e700l7fdvhk 10 -c io1d77dcytfk5fsck089eg7669gfpqunrx35ue5ln -s hdw::1/1/1
```

where `io1m22v9cnnjcktas584wcl96vl5z5e700l7fdvhk` is the recipient and `io1d77dcytfk5fsck089eg7669gfpqunrx35ue5ln` is the ioUSDT token contract address on IoTeX.

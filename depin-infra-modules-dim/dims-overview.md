# DIMs Overview

Whether a DePIN focuses on physical resources or digital resources or targets a specific vertical, it must interface with real-world smart devices that generate an incredible amount of data. The need for a **modular**, **end-to-end tech stack** that connects real-world data to the blockchain world is essential.

Blockchain, as an immutable ledger, is a perfect foundation to **document facts** about what happened in the physical world; however, before writing "**proofs of physical work**" from devices to the blockchain permanently, a series of steps must be completed to **verify the real world activity** that actually happened and if the data is trustworthy.&#x20;

Devices must be registered on-chain, raw data must be collected, parsed, sequenced, and stored, and computations over data must be performed in a verifiable fashion before any "proof of real-world activity" can be settled to a blockchain. The reference architecture above shows **nine essential layers for DePIN projects** to consider.

IoTeX introduced the concept of "**DePIN Infrastructure Modules (DIMs)**" as the methodology enabling any infrastructure builder to provide their implementations for the different layers required to a DePIN project. This provides DePIN projects with a vast array of options for creating their custom tech stack.

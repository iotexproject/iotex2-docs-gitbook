# Register your Node

W3bstream prover onboarding is based on the [ioID DIM module](../../../builders/reference-docs/ioctl-client/ioid-identities.md) and follows the process for [ioID Registration and Binding](broken-reference). An on-chain **fleet management contract** is responsible for scheduling W3bstream tasks and tracking the lifecycle of all the prover nodes.&#x20;

Each prover node can be either in a ‘Busy‘, ‘Idle‘, or ‘Offline‘ status and the node status will be continuously updated in the fleet management contract. A W3bstream explorer can be used to check the status of all prover nodes.

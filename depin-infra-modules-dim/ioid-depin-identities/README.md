IoID is a decentralized identity framework purpose-built to **establish trust in the machine economy**, enabling smart agents and **physical AI** to interact securely and autonomously.&#x20;

IoID includes both on-chain and off-chain components:

{% hint style="info" %}
**On-Chain Identity**:&#x20;

Each machine is represented by an NFT-bound smart contract wallet, enabling it to manage digital assets, receive rewards, and participate in decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols.

**Off-Chain Identity**:&#x20;

ioID integrates self-sovereign identity (SSI) standards—including decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs)—to support secure, privacy-preserving communication between machines and humans (M2P) or other machines (M2M).
{% endhint %}

This section of the documentation covers the concepts, architecture, and integration details of ioID, along with use cases and practical guidance for developers integrating decentralized identity into machine-based applications.

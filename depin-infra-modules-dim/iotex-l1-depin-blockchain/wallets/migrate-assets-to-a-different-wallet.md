# Migrate Assets to a different wallet

Sometimes, it may be necessary to abandon a wallet account, such as when you suspect that your current wallet has been compromised or when rotating addresses for security purposes. In these situations, itâ€™s crucial to ensure that all your assets are successfully migrated to your new wallet.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that new types of assets and services are continually being added to the IoTeX ecosystem, and this guide is not intended to cover every scenario. If you have questions about migrating a specific asset or service to a new account, feel free to ask for assistance in our [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/iotex). &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The instructions below reference hub.iotex.io as the web wallet app; however, the same steps apply to any wallet app you are currently using.
{% endhint %}

## 1. Identify the destination wallet

Identify the new wallet you want to transfer your assets to. If it's a hardware wallet, connect it to Metamask and identify the wallet address.

## 2. Transfer your Tokens

Start by transferring all your ERC20 and NFT tokens from [https://hub.iotex.io/assets](https://hub.iotex.io/assets)

* Transfer ERC20 Tokens
* Transfer all your NFT Tokens, they'll include:
  * Staking IOTX as NFT Buckets
  * DePIN Devices that you own
  * IoTeX Name Service (INS) domain names
  * Any other type of NFT

## 3. Transfer your Staking

Next, move to the [staking section](https://hub.iotex.io/staking#my-stakes) and transfer all your staking buckets to the new address:

## 4. Transfer your DeFi assets

### Liquidity pools

If you created provided liquidity to a pool on [https://mimo.exchange](https://mimo.exchange), you should have received LP tokens for each pool that represent your fractional ownership of the liquidity: just make sure you transfer all the LP tokens to the new wallet.

Other DeFi protocols may also work with the same principle: please do your research and identify the correct steps to migrate your liquidity to a different address.

### Liquid Staking

If you performed IOTX staking on [https://www.bedrock.technology](https://www.bedrock.technology), you have received uniIOTX. These are ERC20 tokens that represent your staked IOTX on the Bedrock Dapp: ensure you transferred them to the new address.

Other similar liquid staking protocols you may have used may also work with the same principle: please do your research and identify the correct steps to migrate your liquidity to a different address.

## 5. Other Protocol Assets

Other DeFi protocols like borrowing/lending, or gaming apps, or any othe Dapp might require you to withdraw your deposits in order to transfer them to a different wallet. Please do your research and identify the correct steps to migrate your assets from these protocols to a different address.

## 6. Transfer your Delegate Profile

If your old account was used to manage an IoTeX Delegate Profile, login to your delegate profile at [https://stake.iotex.io/signin](https://stake.iotex.io/signin) and perform a **Transfer Profile Ownership** to the new address.

## 7. Transfer your IOTX tokens

As a last step, once you transferred all your other assets, you can transfer all your IOTX tokens to the new address.

# Use with Metamask

Using a Ledger Hardware wallet in conjunction with Metamask or a similar Ethereum-compatible software is a seamless and secure way to manage your native IOTX tokens, ERC20 tokens, or your staking on the IoTeX blockchain.&#x20;

The process mirrors the experience of using Ledger with Ethereum blockchain, with a few additional steps to ensure Metamask compatibility with the IoTeX network.

## Prerequisites

* Ledger Hardware Wallet
* Metamask[ installed and configured](../metamask-desktop.md) on your computer
* Latest version of **Ethereum app** installed on your Ledger device

## Configuration Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Ledger to Metamask

1. **Open** Metamask on your browser.
2. **Connect** your Ledger Hardware Wallet to your computer using the USB cable.
3. **Enter** your Ledger PIN to unlock the device.

### Step 2: Unlock the Ethereum App on Ledger

1. **Navigate** through the apps on your Ledger device to find the Ethereum app.
2. **Open** the Ethereum app (e.g., by by pressing both buttons on the Ledger device simultaneously).

### Step 3: Configure Metamask for the IoTeX Blockchain

To ensure that your transactions are processed on the IoTeX network, you must configure Metamask accordingly. You can add the IoTeX Blockchain to Metamask either manually or by going to the [IoTeX Developer Portal home page](https://developers.iotex.io).

### Step 4: Connect Metamask to the IoTeX Blockchain

With the IoTeX network added to your wallet, you can now:

1. **Select** the IoTeX network from the network dropdown menu in Metamask.
2. **Perform** transactions as usual. Your transactions will now be executed on the IoTeX blockchain.
